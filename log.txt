3 mics: 5k samples/sec
~0.2 ms per sample

1 mic:16k samples/sec
0.0625 ms per sample



sounds travel at 300m/s === 0.3m/ms

0.06m = 0.2ms


so the time required to sample one mic introduces a 6 cm bias


TODO:
-individual mic inv/ threshold
-save to flash
-change screen: auto/center should be the main detect mode, and current detect should be 1st info page
